# ü¶† COVID-19 Data Analysis Using SQL

This project analyzes COVID-19 deaths and vaccinations across different countries using SQL in Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS).

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Technologies

- **SQL** (T-SQL syntax)
- **Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)**
- **Windows 10** (local setup)

## üìä Key Analyses Performed

- Global trends in COVID-19 deaths and vaccinations
- Total cases vs. total deaths (likelihood of death if infected)
- Infection rates by country and continent
- Vaccination progress using rolling sum techniques
- Percentage of population vaccinated
- Data cleaning and transformation for accurate analysis

## üìå Sample SQL Features Used

- `JOIN` operations (e.g., combining death and vaccination data)
- `WINDOW FUNCTIONS` (`SUM OVER`, `PARTITION BY`, etc.)
- `CAST` and data type conversions
- `CTEs` and `Views` for modular analysis
- Filtering with `WHERE` and ordering with `ORDER BY`

  ## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Use

1. Import the CSV files into SQL Server.
2. Open the SQL script file.
3. Run queries step by step to explore insights.
